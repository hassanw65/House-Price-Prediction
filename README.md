# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. It utilizes Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to perform data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
House-Price-Prediction/
├── housing-price-prediction.ipynb  # Jupyter notebook with the complete workflow
├── README.md                       # Project documentation
```

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hassanw65/House-Price-Prediction.git
   cd House-Price-Prediction
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *If `requirements.txt` is not provided:*
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook housing-price-prediction.ipynb
   ```

2. **Follow the steps in the notebook:**
   - Load and explore the dataset.
   - Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, feature scaling).
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
   - Make predictions on new data.

## 📊 Results

The notebook provides visualizations and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of different models. It helps in understanding the impact of various features on house prices and selecting the best-performing model for predictions.
